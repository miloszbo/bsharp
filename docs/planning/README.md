# Planning

This directory contains high-level plans, design notes, and progress tracking documents for upcoming features.

## Documents

- `dotscope-cil-plan.md` — Detailed implementation plan for integrating dotscope to enable CIL read/write in BSharp.
- `dotscope-cil-tracking.md` — Completion tracking and milestones for the dotscope integration work.
 - `lsp-module-plan.md` — Detailed implementation plan for the BSharp Language Server Protocol (LSP) module.
 - `lsp-tracking.md` — Milestones and progress tracking for the LSP module implementation.
 - `vnext-vision.md` — Strategic vision for the next major iteration (vNext) linking all major plans.

## Goals

- Keep feature planning close to the codebase.
- Provide clear, actionable design docs with links to relevant modules and APIs.
- Maintain up-to-date progress tracking that mirrors the repository structure.
