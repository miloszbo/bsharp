# CIL Runtime

This section covers the CIL-based code execution feature, including VM design, dotscope-based IL read/emit, and the ASTâ†’IL emitter.

- See the high-level [Overview](./overview.md) and [Architecture](./architecture.md).
- The implementation plan is broken into [Phases](./phases.md).
- For practical IL usage, read the [dotscope Guide](../cil-runtime/dotscope-guide.md).
