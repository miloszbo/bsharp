## Known Limitations

### C# 12.0 Limitations

1. **Inline Arrays**: Not yet implemented
   - Requires `[InlineArray(n)]` attribute support
   - Planned for future release

2. **Interceptors**: Not yet implemented
   - Experimental feature in C# 12
   - May be implemented when feature stabilizes

### C# 13.0 & 14.0 Status

All C# 13.0 and 14.0 features are in preview/development status and planned for future implementation as they stabilize in the official .NET releases.

## Contributing

To add support for new C# features:

1. **Update AST nodes** in `src/syntax/nodes/`
2. **Implement parser** in `src/parser/`
3. **Add comprehensive tests** in `tests/parser/`
4. **Update this matrix** to reflect new support
5. **Document in** relevant parser documentation

See [Contributing Guide](../development/contributing.md) for details.
